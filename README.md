This is a basic ToDo app that helps keeping track of what tasks you need to do. It is very simple: you just need to write down a task and add it to the list. Once the task is done, or you give on it, you shall delete it.
This was one of may very first usable software I ever developed. It is still a work in progress. I do use it and it is deployed on GitHub pages for anyone to use it freely. I really do like it and I'm very proud of it. 
It was made using vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6). Hope you like it!
